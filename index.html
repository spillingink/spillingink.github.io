The history of spilling ink
</div>
<div style="font-size: 15pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; font-family: fantasy;">
<p>Hiya friends!</p>
<p>I got the name spilling ink because first I tried to make my newsletters with ink, but it kept spilling. Eventually my mom got so fed up that she said I should make my newsletters with my laptop then print it out.</p>
<p>I started Spilling ink in 2024. Selling my newsletters once a month for a quarter. But once 2025 began I wanted to reach a new goal and start coding a website. Now look at me!</p>
<p>The inspiration came to me when I wanted to join the school newsletter but wanted to make changes I thought I could not do in the school newsletter. Wanting to make a more “me”, newsletter I created spilling ink. Now, here I am every day working on something new to show the world. If you have any complains or concerns please contact dhristidesai@hotmail.com. And as I always end my introduction pieces in my newsletters.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
